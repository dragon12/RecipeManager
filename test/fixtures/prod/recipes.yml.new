  description: Sliced courgette tossed with a basil pesto sauce and topped with breadcrumbs
    and parmesan.
  comments: Quite nice, although nothing special. Might be better if I was able to
    make real pesto - can use more basil leaves and pine nuts in exchange for the
    store-bought pesto, as in the source recipe.

  description: Spicy meat and beans filling with a cornbread crust topping.
  comments: ! "Quite nice.\r\nWould do the top layer of cornbread thinner next time,
    perhaps having the bulk as a bottom layer instead.\r\n\r\nThe greek yoghurt, milk
    and flour were as a substitute for buttermilk."
