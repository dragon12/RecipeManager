New Recipe:
    - description box needs a border

All recipes page:
    - tidy filter fields
    - better place for 'new recipe' and 'ingredient list' links
    - filter by specific ingredient as well as freeform (i.e. select box)

Show recipe:
    - tidy links

Model:
    add an 'alternatives' set of things
        - comment and link field (both optional)
    category of recipe, and/or tags
    sections of ingredients/method - i.e subrecipes?
    thoughts or breakdown etc

COMPLEX STUFF
    More advanced user authentication for modifications!
        either:
            https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic
            devise

    Edit recipe:
        - step number should auto-populate
            - ideally wouldn't be there at all and would be draggable, but
              this proves tricky! Eventually maybe move to some kind of ajax
              sortable model, but that's for a later date
            - it's non-trivial to auto-populate the step number, no obvious
               way of getting it to work with the dynamic addition of fields
