minor recipe additions:
    wider text fields on categories/recipes page
    wider url
    an entry for total time required, cooking time
    attribute for how many of thing it makes

tab when adding ingredients should add a new row
sortable table on all recipes page
appropriate pluralisation of ingredients
step number maybe shouldn't be an int? e.g. 1a
definitely need sections for ingredients and method

Model:
    ratings - integer 1-10

misc:
    currently can delete categories that are tied to recipes

COMPLEX STUFF
    Model
        tags
        sections of ingredients/method - i.e subrecipes?
        ratings - numeric

    More advanced user authentication for modifications!
        either:
            https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic
            devise

    Edit recipe:
        - step number should auto-populate
            - ideally wouldn't be there at all and would be draggable, but
              this proves tricky! Eventually maybe move to some kind of ajax
              sortable model, but that's for a later date
            - it's non-trivial to auto-populate the step number, no obvious
               way of getting it to work with the dynamic addition of fields
