    Edit recipe:
        - step number should auto-populate
            - ideally wouldn't be there at all and would be draggable, but
              this proves tricky! Eventually maybe move to some kind of ajax
              sortable model, but that's for a later date
            - it's non-trivial to auto-populate the step number, no obvious
               way of getting it to work with the dynamic addition of fields
