wider text fields on categories/recipes page
wider url
tab when adding ingredients should add a new row
an entry for total time required, cooking time
attribute for how many of thing it makes
sortable table on all recipes page
appropriate pluralisation of ingredients
step number maybe shouldn't be an int? e.g. 1a
definitely need sections for ingredients and method

Model:
    ratings - integer 1-10

misc:
    currently can delete categories that are tied to recipes

COMPLEX STUFF
    Model
        tags
        sections of ingredients/method - i.e subrecipes?
        ratings - numeric

    More advanced user authentication for modifications!
        either:
            https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic
            devise

    Edit recipe:
        - step number should auto-populate
            - ideally wouldn't be there at all and would be draggable, but
              this proves tricky! Eventually maybe move to some kind of ajax
              sortable model, but that's for a later date
            - it's non-trivial to auto-populate the step number, no obvious
               way of getting it to work with the dynamic addition of fields
