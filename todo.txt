ingredient measurement type
    - volume
    - weight 
    - item


tab when adding ingredients should add a new row
sortable table on all recipes page
appropriate pluralisation of ingredients
step number maybe shouldn't be an int? e.g. 1a
definitely need sections for ingredients and method
    - add a 'section' column to method which can somehow be sortable if non-null

Model:

COMPLEX STUFF
    Model
        tags
        sections of ingredients/method - i.e subrecipes?

    More advanced user authentication for modifications!
        either:

            devise

    Edit recipe:
        - step number should auto-populate
            - ideally wouldn't be there at all and would be draggable, but
              this proves tricky! Eventually maybe move to some kind of ajax
              sortable model, but that's for a later date
            - it's non-trivial to auto-populate the step number, no obvious
               way of getting it to work with the dynamic addition of fields
