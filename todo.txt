NEXT:
    tidy up some of the behind-the-scenes things now that selectbox is working
    make an add-ingredient popup? Or at least a link to an ingredient-addition page
    some way of ordering or numbering instructions
    add an 'alternatives' set of things - possibly same model as Links
    More attributes to ingredient-quantity - like preparation


ingredient stuff:
    - get edit ingredient working
    - tweak behaviour of create/update ingredient - failure to delete shouldn't result in editable
    - display recipes containing specified ingredient


EDIT:
    method textboxes need to be wider
    textboxes wrapping to next line when filled in
