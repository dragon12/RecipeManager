Minor feature updates:
    welcome page should just be the recipes
    New recipe should start with an empty ingredient/group/instruction/group

More significant features
    Headings on index should be click-to-sort
    appropriate pluralisation of ingredients
    linking to specific other recipes as an ingredient
    tab when adding ingredients should add a new row
    auto-numbering of instructions (on submit if all blank)

known bugs:
    bug in submit ingredient if there's a blank ingredient present - should be ignored
    Shouldn't display times if they're empty


Model:

COMPLEX STUFF
    Model
        tags
        sections of ingredients/method - i.e subrecipes?

    More advanced user authentication for modifications!
        either:
            https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic
            devise

    Edit recipe:
        - step number should auto-populate
            - ideally wouldn't be there at all and would be draggable, but
              this proves tricky! Eventually maybe move to some kind of ajax
              sortable model, but that's for a later date
            - it's non-trivial to auto-populate the step number, no obvious
               way of getting it to work with the dynamic addition of fields
