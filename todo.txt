Model:
    category of recipe (and editable categories)
        - add resource
        - add model/schema - allowed just one category
        - add edit and show page (like ingredients)
        - add link to title bar
        - add column to recipes list
        - add filter to recipes show page

COMPLEX STUFF
    Model
        tags
        sections of ingredients/method - i.e subrecipes?

    More advanced user authentication for modifications!
        either:

            devise

    Edit recipe:
        - step number should auto-populate
            - ideally wouldn't be there at all and would be draggable, but
              this proves tricky! Eventually maybe move to some kind of ajax
              sortable model, but that's for a later date
            - it's non-trivial to auto-populate the step number, no obvious
               way of getting it to work with the dynamic addition of fields
