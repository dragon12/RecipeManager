NEXT:
    tidy up some of the behind-the-scenes things now that selectbox is working
    make an add-ingredient popup? Or at least a link to an ingredient-addition page
    some way of ordering or numbering instructions
    add an 'alternatives' set of things
    More attributes to ingredient-quantity - like preparation


EDIT:
    method textboxes need to be wider
    textboxes wrapping to next line when filled in
